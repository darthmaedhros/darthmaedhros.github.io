### Gang Dynamics
The Mercurio Street Gang operates with a clear hierarchy under Brigid's leadership, though individual members often pursue their own side schemes. They maintain an uneasy relationship with the Howlers, paying tribute while secretly resenting their overlords. The gang's Morlean identity creates both solidarity and self-loathing, as they prey on their own community while seeing themselves as products of systemic oppression.

Their protection rackets focus on small businesses, street vendors, and residential areas in the Old Quarter, using a combination of intimidation, violence, and genuine protection services to maintain control.
